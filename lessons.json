Running code in a browser console:\n   - Open your browser's developer tools.\n   - Navigate to the 'Console' tab and type your JavaScript code.\n\n2. Running code in Node.js:\n   - Install Node.js on your computer.\n   - Open your terminal and run 'node' command followed by your code.\n\n3. Running code in HTML:\n   - Create an HTML file with a script tag and include your JavaScript code.\n   - Open the HTML file in a browser.\n\nBy understanding these methods, you'll be able to experiment and test your code effectively in different environments."

What are variables?\n   - Variables store data and give it a name for easy reference.\n\n2. Declaration and assignment:\n   - Use 'var', 'let', or 'const' to declare variables.\n   - Assign values using the '=' operator.\n\n3. Scope and block-level variables:\n   - Understand the scope of variables and how 'let' and 'const' are block-scoped.\n\nBy the end of this lesson, you'll have a strong grasp of variables and their importance in programming."

Numbers:\n   - Understand integers and floating-point numbers.\n   - Perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\n3. Booleans:\n   - Explore true and false values, crucial for decision-making.\n\n4. Arrays:\n   - Create ordered lists of data items.\n   - Access and manipulate array elements using indices.\n\n5. Objects:\n   - Store data as key-value pairs.\n   - Create and manipulate objects using object literal notation.\n\nBy the end of this section, you'll be well-versed in JavaScript's core data types and how to use them effectively."

Assigning and updating variables:\n   - Assign values using various data types to variables.\n   - Update variables by reassigning them.\n\n2. Mathematical operations:\n   - Perform arithmetic operations on numbers.\n   - Explore addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and the modulo operator.\n\n3. String manipulation:\n   - Concatenate strings to create dynamic text.\n   - Use string methods like 'toUpperCase()', 'toLowerCase()', and 'length'.\n\n4. Accessing arrays and objects:\n   - Retrieve values from arrays using indices.\n   - Access object properties using dot notation or square brackets.\n\nBy mastering these concepts, you'll have a strong foundation for working with variables and performing operations in JavaScript."
